## Hi, I'm Jason

I am a free-lancing (self-employed/consultant) phased array engineer based out of Seattle, WA. My company, [Neon Physics](http://neonphysics.com) helps customers with designing, analyzing, optimizing, testing, and writing software for phased arrays.

You can shoot me an email at [hello@neonphysics.com](mailto:hello@neonphysics.com). You can also find me around these parts:

## Links I like

Below are some links/apps/tools that I really like. Honestly, I am mostly linking them here so they don't get buried in my bookmarks.

- [Paul Tol's Notes](https://sronpersonalpages.nl/~pault/) - Great resource for creating data color schemes.
- [Coloring for Colorblindness](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind) by [David Nichols](https://davidmathlogic.com/) - Resource for ensure color schemes are colorblind safe. I am not personally colorblind but I often use this to double check when I am creating color scheems.
- [Tabler Icons](https://tablericons.com/) - Free SVG icons.
- [Microwaves101](https://www.microwaves101.com/) - If you're in the RF industry, Microwaves101 nees no introduction.
