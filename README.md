## Hi, I'm Jason

I am a free-lancing (self-employed/consultant) phased array engineer based out of Seattle, WA. My company, [Neon Physics](http://neonphysics.com) helps customers with designing, analyzing, optimizing, testing, and writing software for phased arrays.

Additionally, I'm working on a few web based tools focused around phased arrays.
